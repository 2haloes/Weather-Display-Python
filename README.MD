This is a basic readme while the program is being developed and incomplete, this requres Python 3.6 with Tkinter to run (For windows, this should all install with Python, on Linux, it may need to install seprately)

The _gif version is designed for systems that do not have a version of tkinter compatable with .png images, this should only be used if the main script doesn't work (such as in Raspbian)

The images included are under Creative Commons (Attribution 3.0 Unported) as detailed in the Image_LICENSE file. The icons can be found at https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/good-weather-1 The images included include changes to the source which include resizing and trimming and are free to use under the same license.

Please contact me if there are any issues either with the program (When completed) or with the licensing.

This is a tool to setup your own weather display program for any reason and should not breach the terms of service for use of the Darksky API as it is more of an easy setup tool and not a phone app trying to save pennies
