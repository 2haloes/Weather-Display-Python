# This requires Python 3 and Tkinter to run, Windows should include Tkinter with the install, Linux may require installing it seprately

This is a weather display designed to run on embedded devices however it doesn't need to be used like that. It is designed to run at a size of 800x480 and anything bigger may require changes to the program

The _gif version is designed for systems that do not have a version of tkinter compatable with .png images, this should only be used if the main script doesn't work (such as in Raspbian)
